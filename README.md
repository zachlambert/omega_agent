# Setting up

To install porcupine:
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/Picovoice/porcupine.git

Then install the relevant python modules from requirements:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

May need to install pyaudio using:
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
(Since the pip version doesn't work)
